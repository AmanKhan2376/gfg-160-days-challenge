/*
GFG 160 Days Challenge - Day 7 : Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Multiple Transaction Allowed
----------------------------------------------------------
The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. 
Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock at price[i]; 
you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. 
Find the maximum profit that you can get.

Note:
- A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously.
- Multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.

Approach:
---------
- This is a greedy problem.
- If price[i] > price[i - 1], we can profit by buying at i - 1 and selling at i.
- Sum all such positive differences to get the maximum profit.
- Equivalent to accumulating all upward movements in the price array.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
